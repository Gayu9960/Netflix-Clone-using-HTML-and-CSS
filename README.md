# Netflix-Clone-using-HTML-and-CSS
This project is a simple front-end clone of the Netflix homepage built using HTML and CSS. It features a clean layout with a navigation bar, banner section, and movie thumbnails, giving the look and feel of the original Netflix interface. The design is fully responsive and visually engaging.
